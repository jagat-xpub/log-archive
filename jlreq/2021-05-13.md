If the `ch` value for `font-size-adjust` is interpreted similarly, this implies that the same font, with the same `font-size` and `font-size-adjust` properties in effect, will be sized very differently in vertical-upright mode vs horizontal or vertical-sideways.<br><br>Consider a typical Latin font where the horizontal-mode `ch` unit may be, for example, 0.5em; however, the vertical-upright `ch` unit is typically more like 1em. If the author uses `font-size-adjust: ch 0.5`, intending to try and maintain a reasonably consistent width of text, then any content with `writing-mode: vertical-rl; text-orientation: upright` will get this font reduced to half of the computed font-size, because its vertical-upright `ch` of 1em will be scaled down to 0.5.<br><br>While it could be argued this is "expected" -- it's what the author asked for, maintaining a consistent advance for the characters -- I think it would in fact be surprising and undesirable. I believe the natural expectation of authors will be that for a given font, the combination of font-size and font-size-adjust will give a consistent result, not a radically different used size depending on the writing-mode orientation.<br><br>I propose, therefore, that we explicitly define that the `ch` value for `font-size-adjust` refers to _horizontal mode_ character advance.<br><br>Given that this contrasts with the `ch` unit, perhaps sharing the keyword is in fact unhelpful, and we should expand the `font-size-adjust` value to `ch-width` for clarity.<br><br>To allow authors to explicitly request the equivalent adjustment for vertical-upright mode, we could add a vertical-advance version, perhaps called `vch`, or `ch-height` if we expand the horizontal one as suggested above.<br><br>I think all the same issues apply to `ic` as well as `ch`, and we should resolve that similarly, probably by explicitly splitting the value into `ic-width` and `ic-height`. (In many cases, horizontal and vertical advances may be the same, such that the issue is irrelevant, but that is not universally the case. And I think having `ic` and `ch` treated _differently_ in this regard would be even more confusing.)<br><br>(I note that in <https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/6160#issuecomment-814496106|#6160 (comment)>, <https://github.com/fantasai|@fantasai> mentioned that `ic` would be writing-mode dependent, but on reflection I think this is an undesirable result, especially when considered in conjunction with `ch`, where the behavior that results from being writing-mode-dependent seems really jarring.)</blockquote>|

I don't see a need for a new property.</blockquote>|
