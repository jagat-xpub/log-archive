See a <https://w3c.github.io/i18n-tests/results/int-grapheme-word-segmentation#japanese|summary of the results> of some exploratory tests. See <https://github.com/w3c/character_phrase_tests/issues/30|w3c/character_phrase_tests#30> for a discussion about what happens when clicking inside verbs.<br><br>Firefox only selects adjacent rows of characters from the same Unicode block when you double-click in the middle of a sentence.<br><br>Chrome and Safari, however, apply some logic to the resulting selection, so that if you click inside the word 歩きました (depending on where you click) the browser highlights one of the following morphological segments, 歩き, ま, or した.<br><br>The latter is what ICU does. See the <https://icu4c-demos-7hxm2n5zgq-uc.a.run.app/icu-bin/icusegments#1/en|ICU segmentation demo page>.<br><br>My question is whether that's what the average Japanese user wants to happen, or not? Are they happy to be able to select the word root (including incidental hiragana, as in 歩き), or do they get frustrated that they have to constantly extend the selection to get what they want, ie. the whole word?</blockquote>|
